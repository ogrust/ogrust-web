OG Rust Bounties (OGR) is a community-driven initiative which provides funding to selected builders for their contributions to Polkadot. We accept individual applications, and occasionally launch [Calls for Proposals](/calls_for_proposals) (more info soon). OGR is governed by a [curator body](/curators) comprising 5 members. 

Here are the most important criteria that guide our decisions:

* Funding of up to $150,000 per project (paid out in DOT using 7d EMA price);
* The project is endorsed by a reputable authority on Polkadot, such as the Technical Fellowship or OpenGov (WishForChange track);
* Projects that take longer than 2 weeks are broken down in milestones with verifiable deliverables;
* The proposal describes the issue and the technical implementation in sufficient detail;
* For more complex tasks, a technical RFC may be requested as Milestone 1.

As we operate with limited funds provided by the Polkadot treasury, all decisions are guided by our subjective understanding of what is best for Polkadot. We may reject a technically sound application if we don't see its added value in the bigger context of things.
